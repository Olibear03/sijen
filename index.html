			<p>happy birthday, yameimei! i wanna take this opportunity to thank you for existing, 
				I appreciate you so much! You're a friendly and kind soul that people instantly feel drawn to you and comfortable enough to let their walls down (i know bc i didâ€”a lot of ppl did). You have so much care to give for all the special people in your life, your friends and your family, and that's such a wonderful thing. 
				Honestly. not all people has that. But sometimes, I just can't help but wish that people would stop giving you pain because you don't deserve that. Also, the world is already cruel enough so please be gentle to yourself.  You're not the negative things that your brain tells you that you are. You're so much more. 
				Ignore the noise and focus on living your life to the fullest! Once again, janm din ki aapko bahut sare shubhkamanaye!</p>
